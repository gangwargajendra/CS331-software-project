# 🚦 Smart Traffic Signal Automation System

### Software Engineering Lab Project (CS331)

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Smart Traffic Signal Automation System** is an intelligent traffic management solution that automatically controls traffic lights based on real-time road conditions using camera input.

Unlike traditional fixed-timer signals, this system dynamically adjusts green light duration based on traffic density, helping to reduce congestion and improve road efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a computer program that:
- Analyzes live traffic video
- Counts vehicles on each road
- Automatically changes traffic signals
- Prioritizes emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks

---

## ⚙️ Functional Requirements

### 🚗 Vehicle Counting
- Detects and counts cars, trucks, and bikes in each lane using video input.

### 🚦 Dynamic Traffic Light Control
- Adjusts green light duration based on vehicle count.
- Roads with more traffic receive longer green signals.

### 🚑 Emergency Mode
- Detects emergency vehicles (ambulance/fire truck).
- Immediately switches the signal to green for priority passage.

### ⏱️ Safety Timers
- Maintains a minimum green time (e.g., 5 seconds) even if traffic is low.
- Ensures pedestrian safety.

### 🖥️ Display Screen
- Shows:
  - Live camera feed
  - Vehicle count per lane
  - Countdown timer for signal changes

### 🧑‍✈️ Manual Override
- Allows a traffic officer to manually control signals in special situations.

## 🛠️ Non-Functional Requirements

- **Real-Time Performance:**  
  Signal updates occur in under 1 second.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Simple display showing signal status clearly.

- **Offline Operation:**  
  Works without a constant internet connection.

- **Reliability & Fail-Safe Mode:**  
  If the camera fails, the system switches to a fixed-timer mode (e.g., 30 seconds per signal).

## 🧠 Key Features
- Intelligent traffic signal control
- Emergency vehicle prioritization
- Real-time processing
- Manual override option
- Fail-safe fixed-timer mode

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV  
- **GUI:** Tkinter / PyQt  
- **Input Source:** Traffic camera / CCTV feed
